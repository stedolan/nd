Subject: Netsoc account "%(username)s" has been renewed

Your Netsoc account, %(username)s, has been renewed for this year. 

You can log into our servers Spoon and Cube by SSH or via the Netsoc
website. Cube also supports graphical login via NX (download a client
at http://nomachine.com), but is currently only accessible from inside
college.

You can use your webspace on Cube by logging in via SSH (download PuTTY
from http://netsoc.tcd.ie and log into cube.netsoc.tcd.ie) and running
"setup_webspace".

If you've forgotten your password, or have any trouble logging in,
please contact support@netsoc.tcd.ie.
